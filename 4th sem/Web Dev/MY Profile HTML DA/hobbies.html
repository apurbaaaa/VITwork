        <h2>Photography</h2>
        <p>
            Photography is not just a hobby for me; it's a way of capturing and cherishing the world's fleeting moments. Whether it's nature, urban landscapes, or candid shots of daily life, each photograph tells a story and preserves a unique moment in time. I currently only do street photography, however am planning on doing landscape as well. Here are some of my best takes.

        <h2>Playing Guitar</h2>
        <p>
            The guitar is my companion in the journey of music. Playing guitar is a way to express creativity and unwind after a day's work. It's a source of joy and relaxation, allowing me to explore the vast realms of melody and harmony.

        <h2>Travelling</h2>
        <p>
            Traveling opens up new horizons and offers experiences that are invaluable. Exploring different cultures, landscapes, and cuisines is not only enriching but also an essential part of personal growth. It's about stepping out of the comfort zone and embracing the diversity of the world.
