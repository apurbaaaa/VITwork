        <h2>Professional Interests</h2>
        <p>
            After finishing my A-levels, I chose to take a gap year due to the Covid-19 pandemic. During this period, I cultivated a deep interest in Neurology, the human brain, and psychiatry. I am now keen on integrating these passions with the field of computer science which has led me to pursue a bachelors in Computer Science and Engineering.
