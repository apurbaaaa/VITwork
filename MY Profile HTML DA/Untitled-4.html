    <h2>Professional Interests</h2>
    <p>
        Following the completion of my A-levels, I opted for a gap year in response to the Covid-19 pandemic. This period proved to be transformative, as it allowed me to delve into the fascinating realms of Neurology, the intricacies of the human brain, and the study of psychiatry. This newfound interest sparked a desire to merge these areas with my existing passion for computer science. Consequently, this fusion of interests has inspired my current pursuit of a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Engineering, where I aim to explore the intersection of technology and neuroscience.

    <h2>Interests and Hobbies</h2>
    <p>
        In my leisure time, I immerse myself in the art of street photography and the melodies of guitar playing. Street photography allows me to capture the fleeting, yet profound moments of everyday life, providing a unique lens through which I view the world. Meanwhile, playing the guitar offers a harmonious escape, nurturing my creativity and contributing to a well-rounded and balanced lifestyle. These hobbies not only serve as creative outlets but also play a pivotal role in keeping me inspired and energized.
